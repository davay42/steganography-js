# Steganography.js

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to create an online steganographic tool with Javascript without using existing solutions and frameworks.

I started the project in late 2017 after being inspired by Computerphile's video about steganography:
* [Secrets Hidden in Images (Steganography) - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc)

## Development

This is a fairly standard project built with `create-react-app`. No custom scripts, just refer to the Ë™package.json` file.

Internationalization is done with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/). A custom script was written to build the required JSON translation file(s), which you can customize based on your backend/translation service.

To enable web workers through Webpack, I used the `worker-loader` package (imports prefixed by `!worker-loader`).

## Implementation details

The project currently uses a custom implementation of LSB steganography.

- [ ] new formats
    - [ ] research audio steganography
- [ ] refactor worker files
- [ ] refactor React components, update dependencies
- [ ] migrate to Typescript
- [ ] Electron/Webview app ?
- [ ] PWA ?
